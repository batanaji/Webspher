SSL Certificate Creation and Configuration Process
1. Key Database and CSR Creation

Create the key database file (.kdb).

Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) by providing all required details.

Send the generated CSR to the Certificate Authority (CA).

Receive the certificates from the CA:

Server (Personal) Certificate

Root Certificate

Intermediate Certificate(s)

Import the received certificate files (.arm) into the .kdb file.

Restart the web server.

2. Certificate Validity

Personal (Server) Certificate: Valid for 365 days

Root and Intermediate Certificates: Valid for 10/5 years (as per organizational policy)

3. Third-Party CA Certificate Configuration

CSR generation URL:
https://getacert.com/cert/getacert_csr.pl

CA website:
https://getacert.com/

4. Certificate Types

Personal (Server) Certificate: Contains the private key

Signer / Root CA Certificate: Contains the public key

Note: Web server CSR extension is .arm, and the returned certificate is usually in .cer format.

Common Error
Cannot parse certificates in file 
'C:\Program Files\IBM\HTTPServer\conf\localhost-2026-01-06-045528.rdb'.
It is not a valid certificate file.

Creating the Key Database Using iKeyman

Open the iKeyman utility:

cd C:\Program Files\IBM\HTTPServer\bin\ikeyMan.sh


Click Key Database File → New

Select:

Key Database Type: CMS

File Name: cacertkey.kdb

Location: Specify the desired path

Enter a password for the key database.

Set the expiration time for the database.

Select Stash password to a file and click OK.

Ensure:

Database type is CMS

The newly created key database is selected

CSR Creation

In Key Database Content, select Personal Certificate Requests

Click New

Enter the following CSR details:

PostalCode : 545654
ST         : KA
L          : Bengaluru
O          : IT
OU         : Development
CN         : localhost / FQDN
C          : IN


Enter a name for the CSR file and click OK

A confirmation message will appear indicating that the CSR has been created.

Send the generated CSR file to the Certificate Authority.

Certificates Received from CA

The CA will sign the CSR and return:

Server Certificate (Personal Certificate)

Root Certificate

Intermediate Certificate(s)

Installing Certificates
1. Install Root Certificate

Open the iKeyman utility.

Open the existing key database file.

Select Signer Certificates.

Click Add, browse to the root certificate, and click OK.

2. Install Server (Personal) Certificate

In Key Database Content, select Personal Certificates.

Click Receive.

Browse to the server certificate file.

On successful validation, click OK.

IBM HTTP Server (IHS) SSL Configuration

Add the following configuration to the IHS configuration file:

LoadModule ibm_ssl_module modules/mod_ibm_ssl.so

Listen 0.0.0.0:443/
# IPv6 support:
Listen [::]:443

SSLCheckCertificateExpiration 30

<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName localhost
  SSLEnable
  Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
</VirtualHost>

KeyFile "C:/Program Files/IBM/HTTPServer/conf/cacertkey.kdb"
SSLStashFile "C:/Program Files/IBM/HTTPServer/conf/cacertkey.sth"


Restart the IBM HTTP Server and verify the SSL certificate.

Certificate Chain Order

Root Certificate

Intermediate Certificate

Server Certificate (Personal Certificate)

Example OpenSSL CSR Command
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:1024 -nodes \
-out own_getacert_com.csr \
-keyout own_getacert_com.key \
-subj "/C=US/ST=Washington/L=Seattle/O=getaCert/CN=*.getacert.com"

Common Issues After Applying SSL Certificates

DNS hostname mismatch

Typographical errors in certificate details

Missing root or intermediate certificates in the chain

SSL handshake errors

SSL handshake failure due to DNS issues (when another system communicates with the mainframe)

SSL handshake failure due to Common Name (CN) mismatch

Application login failure due to SSL errors

Handshake errors originating from specific hostnames
