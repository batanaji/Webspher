disk already provided by unix team,in this metting all repersentetive will be available with respective technology in the application also RBM 

manager,architecture,client.....we will have discussion with all the componet what should be there in design and what is the use of tha how does it work and 

connectivey id it effect any thing to your technology or successfuly working out as per the AIB (Application Infrastucture Build desing ) all the component we need to 

check with your respective component weither it will supported version or comptability with any other things with the help of AIB desing work flow or is there any 

thing need to modify in desing all the posibility we need to analyz before starting the application . this is the pre-req.
Then build team will build the sever and hand over to middleware team then we will start the configuration .

New concept .


WAS 8.0

1. Installation Manager 
2.Liberty profile IBM to deploy only required custom features instead of deploying a big set of available JEE components. ---(less then 50 MB download ,server startup 
time less then 5 sec,less 50 MB memory footprint)
	- If web-application requires only a servlet engine, then rather than starting all other components liberty profile only starts the WAS kernel
	- To Download 
	https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/

 	http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ibm%C2%AE-websphere%C2%AE-application-server-v85-liberty-profile-developer-tools-eclipse-helios-indigo

	The Liberty Profile is free to use which is good but only in development environment not in production environment. If we want to move to production with the 

Liberty Profile we will anyways need to pay the usual IBM WAS licensing cost which does not sounds good.

3. Most of time used in development environment not in production environment

4. Dynamic Clustering can proactively provision and start or stop new instances of application server Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) based on workload demands. It 

provides the ability to meet Service Level Agreements when multiple applications compete for resources.

I.Based on weight and performance and if the cluster member fails request will routed to other member cluste , cluster member start and stop its depends on workload 

in the environment .
Allow workloads to be classified, prioritized and intelligently routed
5. ODR ( On Demand Router )
6. HPEL :-  High Performance Extensible Logging  provides a convenient mechanism for storing and accessing log, trace, System.err, and System.out information produced by the application server or 

your applications. It is an alternative to the basic log and trace facility, which provided the JVM logs, diagnostic trace, and service log files commonly named 

SystemOut.log/SystemErr.log, trace.log, and activity.log.

1. HPEL log data repository
2. HPEL trace data repositoryLilberty profile.
3. HPEL :- 

logview -monitor - to view log

ps -ef | grep java

In SunOs -- 

/usr/ucb/ps -aluxww | grep java

1.netstat   :- It  will display the network connection for both incomming and outgoing signls for TCP connection 

2.ping :- This command is used to test the reachability of host or(server) ip  
3.nslookup (n-name s- server lookup):-This command identifies which DNS server the computer is currently configured to use for its DNS lookups.(or to obtain the domain 

name and ip address of any other specific recod.
4. telnet :- Telenet command is used to communicate with a remote computer like ex:- telenet hostname portnumber

1. top			To check JVM utilization in UNIX (sar -r user to check todays CPU utilization )
3. topas 		To check JVM utilization in AIX it will shows the (user PI,PPID,CPU%,PAGESPCE You should look at first only CPU% utilization how much spac it 

using )
4. prstat		To check the CPU utiliztion  (solari
5. prtconf		to check bit in AIX ()
6. free		 	to check memory utilization 
7. mstat		mpstat is used to monitor cpu utilization on your system (AIX)
8. arch 		To check bit in linux
9. Crontab 		Min:hour:DayOfMonth:month:DayofWeek example:- 0-59:0-23:0-31:0-12:0-6	 options -l,-e,-r 30:2:2:7

find files by modification time
===============================

find . -mtime 1               # 24 hours
find . -mtime -7              # last 7 days
find . -mtime -7 -type f      # just files  ---> ( It will show the file last 7 day before modified )
find . -mtime -7 -type d      # just dirs

or

		EX:- find -atime +15	

		find atime +15 (a --> access time +15 is before 15 days file access it will display)
		find ctime +10 (c --> cheange file before 10 days ... )
		find mtime +10 (m --> Modify the file before 10 daysfi)

Examples :-
===========

1.find / -name SystemOut.log / find /opt -name SystemOut.log


1.Find out which file is using more then 100 MB

pre-req
========
1.first we  will take the back of inv or else security.xml file ,soap.client.prop and ssl.client.prop files,sas.client.prop.

1. We will send the performa to security team SSL like cell level or node leve and (MCSA000C.wart7appap006l.tsit.wgbgrp.test)or webcell095 (Cell name and node name)
2. Onc we get the reference numbere and authoriztion code and details form secutiry team then whit the help of we will create the .jks file (.csr)
3. Then we will paste this info in CA site like entrust,symantec or verizon or etc , then will get the .cer file .
4. The same file we will convert or import into .jks file and will add in that ROOTCA AND INTERCA CERT.
5. Then will place the file in respective locaiton and provide the path of certificat in security.xml file ..and chenge the soap.client.props and ssl.client.props file 

and bounce it and check...


1.keytool -genkey -alias wart7appap047 -keyalg RSA -keystore wart7appap047.jks -keysize 2048  -- generate keystore
2.keytool -certreq -alias wart7appap047 -keystore wart7appap047.jks -file wart7appap.csr	      -- .csr 
3.keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias root -file rootca.crt -keystore wart7appap047.jks     -- import CA sllry .csr also


IIS SSL:-
========
1. right click and properties certificate new certificate / save .csr file
 
SSL Handshak
============
1. Client will send the Hello message with some cryptographic informaiton like TLS and SSL version. (with the help of private key)
2. Server responsed with server hello message that contains ciphereSuite chosen by server from the list of provided by client (with the help of private key)


Keys and Secrets during RSA SSL negotiation
============================================
The following is a standard SSL handshake when RSA key exchange algorithm is used:

    Client Hello (client will send the hello with TLS ,SSL,version
    - Information that the server needs to communicate with the client using SSL.
    - Including SSL version number, cipher settings TLS,session-specific data.
     
    Server Hello
    - Information that the client needs to communicate with the server using SSL.
    - Including SSL version number, cipher settings,TLS session-specific data.
    - Including Serverâ€™s Certificate (Public Key)
     
    Authentication and Pre-Master Secret

    - Client authenticates the server certificate. (e.g. Common Name / Date / Issuer)
    - Client (depending on the cipher) creates the pre-master secret for the session,
    - Encrypts with the server's public key and sends the encrypted pre-master secret to the server.
     
    Decryption and Master Secret
    - Server uses its private key to decrypt the pre-master secret,
    - Both Server and Client perform steps to generate the master secret with the agreed cipher.
     
    Generate Session Keys
    - Both the client and the server use the master secret to generate the session keys, which are symmetric keys used to encrypt and decrypt information exchanged 

during the SSL session
     
    Encryption with Session Key
    - Both client and server exchange messages to inform that future messages will be encrypted.

Fixpack
=======

steps to apply fixpack 
=======================   
pre -req
========
1. Firt stop all the process (jvm,nodeagent,dmgr) and take the backup of product binaries.
2. Confrim that no process are running  using ps -ef | grep java -ef | grep httpd and -ef | grep LLAWP  out put shot be none.

1. First install update installer 
2. Download fixpack or copy from repository server and unzip 
3. Copy it to maintenance direcoty of update installer 
4. run the command ./update -options "responsefile.txt" -silent 
5. and check the ./versionInfo.sh

SSL
===

1. SSL HandShake Error (DNS)
======================
1. Applied SSL on IHS ,IHS team getting error like SSL HandShake i have checke the certificate entries personal certificate ,root CA certificat and InterCA certificate.
2. Everything is fine but still getting the error SSLHandShake then i checked in httpd.conf ssl modul.so (key file .sth file) there also everything is fine comman name 

cn=www.ysf.web.wgbrp.test.
3. Then i have cheked basic command weither this comman name is configured in DNS or not nslookup hostname then i found DNS entry is not availble in DNS server command 

name.
4. once it configured DNS and then itis working fine.

2. SSL HandShake Error  (Certificate comman name missmatch entery)
======================
1. Getting SSL HandShak Error when they are hitting applicaiton or log in to applicaiton.
2. Then i have checked the certificate .pfx or .jks ( personal certificate of ROOTCA and INTERCA but in personal certificate having 2 entries.
    1. Keyentry 2. trustedEntery.

3. With the help of openssl command i opend .pfx file or .jks

	EX:- openssl pkcs12 -info -in /web/build/YourSafe/www.ysf-t1.tsit.wgbgrp.test.pfx
	

4.  Then have found that keyentry of certificate lable name are line some different numric charctore ( genration of certificate infosys team) i took backup file and 

chenaged the Label name.

	keytool -changealias -alias {3bb1f116-e548-4e85-8df5-b68eeb7f2f11} -destalias www.gfsobiee.wgbgrp.net -keystore /web/build/YourSafe/Certificate_5July/ysf.kdb 
5. Then done bounce the webserver and WAS it's resovled.

3.Console is taking more time to open some time 10 some time 15 min
===================================================================

---> There was LDAP is integrated with application and to open the admin console it is taking more time , so there is the option called Reuse_connection this option 

every time it will use the old connection and to check the user id and password so its take the more time , so we have uncheck the Reuse_Connection so it will create 

the new fresh connection and it will connect the directly ... without takeing time .



4.Unable to login in application home page
----------------------------------------------
SSl certificate expired not able login in application login home page 
1. Replaced SSL certificate in WAS level.(still not able to login to application login page).
2. Once WebServer bounced then working fine (or else do generate and propagate plugin_cfg.xml file.
==================================


5. Got application initilizaiton fail.
====================================
There were heap memory  problem getting error in sysout heap memory not sufficient we have increse the heap memory of JVM with the of CR the now working fine.

====================================

6. Application Performance issues too slow .
===========================================
There was applicaiton performance issues i have taken the heap and thread dump there was pool object issue i have ananlyzed and code level has been modified the 

application performance was good 

7. Applicationi deploy succesfull but not able to synch 
=======================================================
it was problem with IHS admin process it is hung state just we restated then it regenrated and propogeted to 

webserver then successfull deployment.

=======================================

8. Deploment fauilr plugin genration and propogation issues.

There was issues with connectivity between appserver and webSere i have chekced ping to appserver to webserver with ip of webserver it was not reaching to webspere , 

Then i have chekced with load balance team,they bounce the VIP from there end and issue got reslove.

=========================================

9. portalURL is not working   

Just I have cleared temp and wstemp ( taken backup and cleard)                                                          

===========================================
10.SQLException thrown while trying to get Connection from Datasource (java:comp/env/xmeta_defaultDS)

Please check if the repository table space is full . Please confirm with Oracle and let us know once Oracle is working we will be able to restart the ISF server , 
Logging agent and Data stage

11. Applied 7.0.0.39 to 7.0.0.41 but application is not able to work proper. 
===========================================================================
Good resolution is befor appling fixpack 7.0.0.41 just chane the JVM proprty to  for JVM which is going to apply PF or node. 
So that while starting the applicaiton you will not get any problem if not you will get problem.

Name: com.ibm.websphere.tls.disabledAlgorithms, Value : none
Name: com.ibm.websphere.certpath.disabledAlgorithms, Value : none

After updating WAS7 with FP41 we had an issue of starting of applications which uses SSLv3 and TLS1.0. FP41 which programmatically disables the connections which are 

made with SSLv3 and TLS1.0. we should manually enable the below parameters to work on. This was corrected in the lower environments. I am adding @Budhia, Amiya R from 

CEB  he will provide the Prod jvm’s which we need to take care. 


11.Received fatal alert: handshake_failure No ciphers specified (Disbled TLSv.0  and enalbed TLSv1.2 in webserver level not working then enabled TLSv1.0 then working fine)
==========================================

this time we need to enable TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 on Load Balancer then it will work.

--> We had disbled TLSv1.o and enabled TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 in webserver because of that it is not working once it is enabled TLSv1.0 it is working fine.
I have 2 important points to make:

1)The change I made yesterday will not work completely until Mark makes the corresponding changes on the load balancer so that it does not use TLS 1.0.  So you 

will see the cipher errors until that is done and it is an outage for those apps until the change is done.  He mentioned yesterday he hopes to get to that by the end 

of today (Tuesday).

2)It looks like another issue exists that will make this implementation more complicated.  It appears the EBT app talks to Useradmin using TLS 1.0, so by 

disabling TLS 1.0 yesterday, we broke their app.  So you need to start including EBT and I would also advise including RISK/CheckSystems in your validation as they 

have hooks into UserAdmin as well.  There most likely will need to be a corresponding change on the EBT Edge appservers to disable TLS 1.0 and use TLS 1.1/1.2.  I 

12. Applied 8.0.0.13 getting Conneciton has been shutdown Javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeExceptio. then i have changed Quality of protection SSL_TLS2 now working fine.
=============================================================================
1.|ERROR|2017-07-30 18:13:42.278 - CDT|ac638fd0-757c-11e7-a1e5-00000a1ef4be|JSession Unknown|EASRetrieveBankAlertInfoXmlDAO.composeSdnMatchSummarySvcRequest

13. Application not able to log in just got hung status.

Crontab

Adding the crontab entry:
You need to be careful when adding a new crontab schedule as if there are existing crontabs that you do not overwrite them, but add them to the existing file.

As root

1.Write the current crontab entry to a file:
crontab -l > cron_file

Edit the file and add the following lines to the end of the file:
#
# Self-heal - supported by DSS_Middleware
#
0,15,30,45 * * * * /sysap/selfheal/selfheal.sh /sysap/selfheal/selfheal.properties >/dev/null 2>&1

Submit the crontab:
crontab cron_file


2.Verify the cron schedule was added by checking the output of:
crontab -l

bash-3.2# /sbin/ifconfig -a|grep 'IP'

2.I have patched  WAS8 AppServerBase1 to 8.0.0.13 on r02dmapp01a

These are the nodes present on that

r02dmapp01a_base1_node1 

r02dmapp01a_base1_node2 


rest all the changes were already in place I have verified them

1.SSL certificate and key management > SSL configurations > CellDefaultSSLSettings > Quality of protection (QoP) settings

2.and in profiles/ProfileNAme/properties
ssl.client.properties
soap.client.props
sas.client.props
change SSL_TLS
to SSL_TLSv2

3.and  in java/jre/lib/security
edit java.seurity
and in last line 
jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms=TLSv1

in the administrative console to retrieve the certificate and resolve the problem. If you determine that the request is trusted, complete the following steps: 1. Log 

into the administrative console.  2. Expand Security and click SSL certificate and key management. Under Configuration settings, click Manage endpoint security 

configurations. 3. Select the appropriate outbound configuration to get to the (cell):System_Cell:(node):d05jbapp08_base1_node1 management scope. 4. Under Related 

Items, click Key stores and certificates and click the NodeDefaultTrustStore key store. 5. Under Additional Properties, click Signer certificates and  Retrieve From 

Port.  6. In the Host field, enter localhost in the host name field, enter 33904 in the Port field, and localhost_cert in the Alias field. 7. Click Retrieve Signer 

Information.  8. Verify that the certificate information is for a certificate that you can trust. 9. Click Apply and Save.

Can this be renamed to idp_root.cer and can the old root.cer be restored?  This is causing other teams issues.  I didn’t consider that the certs were added to the 

truststore this morning when I was informed that the TLS1.2 change would not work as requested.

===================
Business Impact:
Everbank and Bank of Leumi had issues connecting the MQ server using their prime applications

Current Status:
An issue with Primary group association for mqm ID which was introduced by BoKs at some point which caused some Queue managers to not start, its a WebSphere MQ 

behavior to not start the Queue manager if the mqm ID is NOT associated with Primary group mqm.
There is a possibility that Boks had created application group for CIBC and the two BDOC MQ servers were for some reason part of this group.
So they were getting incorrect group assignments. To resolve the issue UNIX team modified the /etc/passwd file for proper UID-GID mapping at 1:50 CT. 
Later at 4:45 CT, Boks team removed the two MQ servers from the larger BoKS Application group to be moved to a dedicated group with proper UID and GUID combination, so 

that the incorrect UID and GID mappings do not resurface when the /etc/passwd file is pushed. 

Resolution Time: 01:50 CT
Bridge disbanded at : 04:54 CT


Scope of Impact:
Everbank and Bank of Leumi had issues connecting the MQ server using their prime applications

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause is still being researched. 

======================
We(CeB) are not receiving the Authentication related messages from eAM at this point of time. Could you please assign this to someone to validate the below:
MQ related.
Answer :- Listern prot was down so we have start then working fine.

take one more issue form subbu mail

247 Error messages form detailded logs

stirng was not recognized as a valid date time

there were 8 messages was stucked in queue so we have cleared the working fine .

Listener
=======
A listener port is a component of the application server that monitors a JMS destination, looks for messages, and is managed by the message listener service.

Server->server1->communication->messaning->Message Listener Services -> Listener port
Applicatioin -

Steps to create JMS and Q in admin console. 

1. JMS:- It provides Connection factory for JVM destinaiton.A JMS provider enables messaging based on the Java Message Service (JMS). It provides J2EE connection factories to create connections for JMS destinations

click on Queue conneciton factory -> New -> select the socp of may be cell level of node level -> select provide  -> give the name of CF -> JNDI NAME -> Queue Manager name -> transprot type - client -> hotstname -> port number -> server connetion channel name -> 
1.Scop :- Celllevel or node level.
2.Select provide :-  Websphere MQ messaging provider.
3.Give the name of CF :- 
4.JNDI Name :- 
5.Queue Manager name :- 
6.Transport type :- Client
7.Host Name :- 
8.Port number :- 4501
9.Server Connection channel:-

2. Creating Q in Admin cosole 

	click on Queues and provide scop,providertype,Name,JNDIName.



2. Connetion Factory :- A connection factory is used to create connections to the associated JMS provider. These connection factories can be used for accessing JMS Queue and JMS Topic destinations. 

3. Queue connection factories :- A queue connection factory is used to create connections to the associated JMS provider of the JMS queue destinations, for point-to-point messaging.

4. Activation Specificaiton :- A JMS activation specification is associated with one or more message-driven beans and provides configuration necessary for them to receive messages.
