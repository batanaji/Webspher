SSL Certificate Overview and Configuration
Viewing Web Server Certificates

Before applying a certificate, you can view the web server certificate in a browser (including certificates from other websites). Common Certificate Authorities (CAs) include:

DigiCert Global CA G2

GlobalSign RSA OV SSL CA 2018

Venafi

IBM HTTP Server (IHS) SSL Configuration
Key Management Utility

IBM iKeyMan (Key Management Utility) is used for SSL certificate management in IHS.

Certificate Formats / Extensions

Key database: .kdb

Stash file: .sth

Request database: .rdb

The .sth file stores the encrypted password for the .kdb file.

Types of Certificates
Self-Signed Certificate

The certificate is signed by the same entity that creates it.

Commonly used for testing or internal environments.

Third-Party (CA-Signed) Certificate

The certificate is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

Used in production environments for public trust.

Steps to Create a Self-Signed Certificate

Open iKeyMan Utility

cd C:\Program Files\IBM\HTTPServer\bin\ikeyMan.sh


Click Key Database File → New

Select:

Key Database Type: CMS

File Name: Enter a suitable name

Location: Specify the path for the key database file

Click OK

Enter a password for the key database.

Set the Expiration Time (certificate validity period).

Select Stash password to a file and click OK.

Ensure:

Database type is CMS

The newly created key database is selected in the Key Database File field

Under Key Database Content, select Personal Certificates and click New Self-Signed.

Enter a suitable Key Label.

Provide the required certificate details and click OK.

In the Common Name (CN) field, specify the hostname.

Restart IBM HTTP Server (IHS).

Test access using:

http://localhost:80
https://localhost:443


Generate and propagate the WebSphere plug-in.

Enabling SSL in IBM HTTP Server

Edit the httpd.conf file and uncomment or configure the following entries as required:

LoadModule ibm_ssl_module modules/mod_ibm_ssl.so
Listen 0.0.0.0:443
## IPv6 support:
Listen [::]:443
SSLCheckCertificateExpiration 30

<VirtualHost *:443>
  ServerName localhost
  SSLEnable
  Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
</VirtualHost>

KeyFile "C:/Program Files/IBM/HTTPServer/conf/ihsserverkey.kdb"
SSLStashFile "C:/Program Files/IBM/HTTPServer/conf/ihsserverkey.sth"

restat IHS webserver
