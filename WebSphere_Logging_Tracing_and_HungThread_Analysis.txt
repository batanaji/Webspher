5. FFDC Logs (First Failure Data Capture)

FFDC logs are generated automatically when a failure occurs in WebSphere. These logs help the IBM PMR support team analyze issues at the time of failure.

File Name: activity.log

Format: Binary format (can be analyzed by IBM PMR team only)

Note: For each profile, only a single FFDC log is generated

Location:

C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer_1\profiles\AppSrv01\logs\ffdc

6. Trace Logs

Trace logs provide complete and detailed information about application and server behavior. Tracing should be enabled only when required for major issue analysis and disabled after the issue is resolved to avoid performance impact.

Steps to Enable Trace:

Fletcher Logging and Tracing
2. Select server1
3. Choose Diagnostic Trace Service
4. Click Change Log Detail Levels
5. Provide the required trace specification and save

Log File Generated:
SystemOut_<CurrentTimestamp>.log

7. Enabling Trace for Web Server Plugin

To enable trace for the WebSphere Plugin:

Go to the Admin Console

Navigate to:
Web Servers → webserver → Plug-in Properties

Enable the required trace settings and save the configuration

Common WebSphere Errors / Issues

Hung Thread

Out of Memory Exception

Disk Space Issues

CPU Starvation

SSL Handshake Issues

Synchronization Issues

1. Hung Thread

A hung thread represents a snapshot of live running threads inside the application server.

A hung thread may impact a specific application, not necessarily all applications.

Hung thread details are written to SystemOut.log.

When threads are hung, application performance degrades.

Causes of Hung Threads:
1. Faulty Application Deployment

If a faulty application is installed on the server, threads may not complete execution.

Example:

A request is received and assigned to Thread1, but it does not complete.

Another request arrives and attempts to use the same resource.

This can result in a deadlock situation.

2. Infinite Loop in Code

If the application code runs into an infinite loop, the thread remains occupied.

If database connections are not closed properly, it may cause connection pool exhaustion.

This may lead to errors such as:
“Unable to open database connection.”

3. Backend Resource Issues

If dependent resources such as the Database Server are down, application threads may hang.

Application Server → Database Server

Hung Thread Detection

If a thread runs for more than 10 minutes, it is marked as a Hung Thread.

Hung thread information is logged in SystemOut.log.

Thread Dump Generation

Before restarting the application server, thread dumps must be generated to analyze the issue.

Thread dumps help identify the state of hung threads, such as:

Running threads

Stopped threads

Deadlocked threads

Ways to Generate Thread Dump

Using wsadmin

Using Admin Console

Using command line:

wsadmin.bat -lang jython -c "AdminControl.invoke(AdminControl.queryNames('type=JVM,process=server1,*'), 'dumpThreads')"
