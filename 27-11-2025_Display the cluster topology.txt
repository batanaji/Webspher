Display the cluster topology.

1. Update the runtime weight.

2. Display the hostnames for both Host1 and Host2, including their respective nodes.

3. Show detailed synchronization information, including node updates.

4. Create a new cluster member named **Cluster_member4_host1** on Host1.

5. After creating the cluster member, synchronize the nodes and then start the new member.

6. Demonstrate the stop and start operations from both the server level and cluster level — stop an individual member and start all members from the cluster.

7. Display the cluster status in both **partial start** and **fully started** states.

8. Show the Ripple Start option.

9. Display the Deployment Manager configuration with all nodes and servers from the following directory path:

  /opt/IBM/WAS/9.0/profiles/dmgr/config/cells/ip-172-31-19-246Cell01/nodes

10. Reference IBM documentation for **Dynamic Workload Manager (DWLM)**:
    [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-zos/9.0.5?topic=settings-dynamic-workload-manager-dwlm-collection](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-zos/9.0.5?topic=settings-dynamic-workload-manager-dwlm-collection)
    (Example: `DM_CLM1_host1`)

11. Note: Once a cluster member is created, its name cannot be modified — it must be unique within the node.

12. In production environments where downtime is not acceptable, this approach can be used to ensure continuous availability[Ripple statrt button using]
