
🔧 STEP 1 — Disable security TEMPORARILY on DMGR

⚠️ This is safe if done exactly as below.

On DMGR host:

cd "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer_1\profiles\Dmgr01\bin"
stopManager.bat


Edit:

C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer_1\profiles\Dmgr01\config\cells\<CELL_NAME>\security.xml


Change:

<security:Security enabled="true">


to:

<security:Security enabled="false">


Save.

Start DMGR:

startManager.bat

🔧 STEP 2 — Sync node WITHOUT authentication

On NODE:

cd "C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\AppServer_1\profiles\AppSrv01\bin"
syncNode.bat localhost 8879


✅ This will succeed now.

🔧 STEP 3 — Re-enable security

Stop DMGR again:

stopManager.bat


Edit the same security.xml back to:

<security:Security enabled="true">


Start DMGR:

startManager.bat

🔧 STEP 4 — Start nodeagent
startNode.bat

🔧 STEP 5 — Start server1 from DMGR

Admin Console → Servers → WebSphere application servers → Start

✅ FINAL STATE (EXPECTED)

In DMGR Admin Console:

🟢 Nodeagent → Running

🟢 Server1 → Running

No more SOAP auth errors

🧠 WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE

IBM officially supports temporary security disable for recovery

Avoids reinstall, re-federation, or profile deletion

Fixes all broken admin auth paths at once

🧨 IF YOU WANT A CLEANER LONG-TERM FIX

I can also guide you through:

Resetting DMGR admin password properly

Re-federating the node cleanly

Hardening SSL after recovery

Just tell me which one you want 👍
