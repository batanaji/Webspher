Session Management – Synchronization

Synchronization is the process of replicating configuration changes from the Deployment Manager (DMGR) to the Application Server / Node level repository. This ensures that all nodes in the cell have consistent and updated configuration data. Synchronization can occur automatically or manually based on the configuration and node agent status.

1. Node Agent Running

When the Node Agent is running, synchronization between the master repository (DMGR) and the node-level repository can happen in different ways.

1.1 Automatic Synchronization

Automatic synchronization occurs at regular intervals when enabled.

If changes made in the DMGR are not getting updated on the application server:

Go to the Node Agent in the administrative console.

Navigate to File Synchronization Service.

Ensure that the Automatic Synchronization checkbox is enabled.

Once enabled, the node agent periodically checks for changes and synchronizes them automatically.

1.2 Manual Synchronization

Manual synchronization is initiated explicitly by the administrator.

In the master repository, every file and folder has a unique identifier called an Epoch Number.

When any configuration change is made in the master repository:

The epoch number is updated.

During manual synchronization, the node agent compares epoch numbers between:

Master repository (DMGR)

Node-level repository

If differences are detected, only the changed files are synchronized to the node-level repository.

This method is efficient because it synchronizes only modified data, not the entire repository.

1.3 Full Synchronization

Full synchronization does not compare epoch numbers.

It copies the entire data from the master repository and replaces the data in the node-level repository.

This is usually used when:

Normal synchronization fails

Repository corruption occurs

Configuration mismatch issues arise

Important points:

Epoch numbers are not checked during full sync.

Epoch numbers do not change when a full synchronization is performed.

Full sync ensures complete consistency but takes more time compared to manual sync.

2. Node Agent Stopped

When the Node Agent is stopped: we have to run the synchnode.sh command to do the synchronization
