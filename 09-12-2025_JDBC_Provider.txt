WebSphere Database Connectivity Components

WebSphere uses several components to establish and manage connections between the application server and the database:

JDBC Provider

DataSource

J2C Authentication

Component Details
1. JDBC Provider

The JDBC provider acts as the runtime environment that enables communication between the WebSphere Application Server (WAS) and the database.

Once configured, applications can use this connection to interact with the backend database.

Supported databases include Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, etc.

2. DataSource

A DataSource represents a connection pool.

It provides ready-to-use and reusable database connections, improving performance and reducing overhead.

Without a DataSource, developers would need to write code to create database connections manually, which are not pooled or reusable.

After defining a JDBC provider, multiple DataSources can be created under it—depending on infrastructure requirements.

Types of Transaction Management:

Local Transactions → simple DataSource (non-XA)

XA DataSource → supports global transactions, often used when multiple databases are involved.

XA DataSources follow a two-phase commit process:

The Transaction Manager checks whether all participating database systems are ready to commit.

If confirmed, the transaction is committed globally; otherwise, it is rolled back.

Connection pools are maintained by a Pool Manager thread. One important setting controlling this is the Reap Time, which defaults to 180 seconds.

Types of JDBC Drivers
Type	Description
Type 1	JDBC-ODBC Bridge
Type 2	Thick Driver
Type 3	Network Driver
Type 4	Thin Driver (Pure Java)
Important Connection Pool Properties
Property	Meaning
Maximum Connections	Maximum number of connections allowed in the pool
Minimum Connections	Minimum number of connections kept ready
Reap Time	Interval (in seconds) between maintenance runs for cleanup
Connection Timeout	Time a request waits if no connection is available
Unused Timeout	Time after which an idle connection is removed (Default: 1800 sec or 30 min)
Aged Timeout	Time after which a physical connection is discarded
Purge Policy

Defines how WebSphere handles stale or failed connections:

Policy	Behavior
Entire Pool	All connections are discarded
Failing Connection Only	Only the connection that failed is discarded
