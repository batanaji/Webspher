3. Hard disk storage (Disk Space)

Problem with application logs:
Application logs can become very large and thus fill up the available storage space, e.g. in the directory
/app/websphere/.

Impact of Server Patching:
During server patching activities, directories for other components may become full, impacting server operation.
Verification:
Check disk space using the commands df -hor df -g(memory check).

Increased log generation in case of errors:
When problems occur in the application or the database, more logs are written, which can quickly fill up directories.

In such cases, we receive tickets or alerts (Impact 1 / Impact / Priority Application).

Example:
ntivesteero.log– Size approx. 1 GB

4. CPU Starvation (CPU usage problem)

Point 1: Too many threads, too little CPU

Scenario:
WebSphere is configured with a large thread pool (e.g., 300 threads), but the server only has 2–4 CPU cores.
The threads are ready to execute, but the CPU cannot handle them all simultaneously.

Effects:

Very high CPU usage (90–100%)

The application becomes extremely slow.

Requests are timed out.

Solution:

Reducing the WebSphere thread pool size

Increasing the number of CPU cores (scale-up or additional nodes)

Correct capacity planning based on the load

Note:
CPU starvation occurs when WebSphere threads are available, but the CPU is too busy to execute them.

5. SSL Handshake Problem

An SSL handshake problem was detected during the IHS SSL configuration, specifically at line number 2422 .

6. Synchronisationsproblem in WebSphere

A WebSphere synchronization problem occurs when configuration changes in the Deployment Manager (DMGR) are not applied to the nodes.

Possible influencing factors:

Change of the database system time

Application server

Scenario 1: Application changes are not visible on the node.

Description:
An application is updated in the Deployment Manager (DMGR), but the changes are not visible on the Node Agent / Application Server.

What happens:

Changes are saved in the DMGR.

Node is not being synchronized

Old configuration remains active

Symptoms:

Old UI or old logic still visible

No errors during deployment

Different application behavior on different nodes

Cause:

Node Agent is stopped

Automatic synchronization is disabled.

Solution:

Start Node Agent

Perform manual synchronization:
System Administration > Nodes > Full Resynchronize

Alternatively: Stop the Node Agent and resynchronize.

Certificate update at the application level (node ​​level)

Problem:
Certificate was updated at the application level.

Impact:
Synchronization did not work correctly.

RCA (Root Cause Analysis):

The configuration between the DMGR Admin Console and the Application Node was not synchronized or identical.

The hostname did not match between the node and the Deployment Manager (DMGR).

Solution steps

DMGR page:

DMGR stoppen (stopManager.sh)

Disable security ( enable=falsein security.xml)

Start DMGR ( startManager.sh)

Node-Level (Application Server):

Stop Node Agent

Perform synchronization:
syncNode.sh <Hostname_des_DMGR> 8879
